# ILR-Calc

This app is modified from the Sample todo app of MDN/todo-react.

This app is for learning purposes ONLY and it is never meant to be a production calculator for ANY purposes.
The code is UGLY and I have no intention to improve that since it is just a quick learning project.

The app is based on MDN todo app.
[Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks
: React tutorials](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#React_tutorials).

I would like to thank MDN on such great ReactJS learning tutorial.
